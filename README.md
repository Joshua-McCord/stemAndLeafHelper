# stemAndLeafHelper

Simple C++ CLI program to create Stem and Leaf plot from inputed data. 
Made for my stats class so I wouldn't have to parse all the data myself. 
(Not fully tested, developed and then abandoned since the class is over
and I exempted the final, I don't really have a further use for it!)
